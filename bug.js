This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, when the `purge` or `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` is incorrectly configured. This can lead to styles not being included in the final CSS output, resulting in unexpected visual glitches or missing styles.  The problem often arises when the paths specified in the `content` option don't correctly match the location of your template files.
